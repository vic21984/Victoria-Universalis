# Victoria Universalis Mod

This mod reworks the core gameplay of vanilla Victoria 2 and introduces new mechanics, such as the ability to dynamically target provinces for province events and a national idea system that allows players to choose from a list of bonuses to their country. As of version 1.0 it also adds the production system, political clout, and companies from Victoria 3.

Many flavor countries and decisions have been imported over from HPM, GFM, and TGC with the decisions and events being modified to be more impactful in terms of gameplay and faster in terms of game performance.

The 1914 scenario in previous versions was removed as of v1.0, it might be re-introduced at a later date.
