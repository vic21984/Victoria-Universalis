###### India:
* Civilized British Raj will split up into India and Pakistan instead of Indian minor nations if the Raj gains independence without becoming a GP first. Uncivilized East India Company will still break up into various Indian minor nations if it becomes independent.

This new system ensures that they will never have a high enough savings account to interger overflow while also always giving them enough money to spend on their needs.

## Gameplay changes:
* Re-enabled firing of RGO workers. This shouldn't change much due to the world bank buying up all excess RGO goods which should result in little to no RGO unemployment anyway.
* Set supply cost of all ships to 1. The only limiting factor for the size of your navy is how much you can afford.
* Heavily reduced stats of all naval units in order to nerf military score gain from late game navies. The balance between ships was kept - later tech units will beat earlier tech units of the same cost and submarines beat big ships but lose to small ships.

* Clipper and Steamer Transports require a level 1 port to build.
* Modern Naval Doctrine now gives -50% naval attrition instead of +1 port level.

* Reduced cost of Good Healthcare and Universal Healthcare by 10%.
* Buffed monthly leadership gain from Leadership Idea from 2 to 3.
* Every country has a truce with the World Bank and Ghostland until the end of the game in order to prevent GPs from wasting influence trying to sphere them.

###### China:

# Version 0.73 - 7/13/2022
## Bug fixes:
* Made soldiers middle class and disabled assimilation of middle classes. There is an assimilation glitch that can make POPs go past their limit, e.g. soldiers going above 5% and clergy going above 4%. Grouping soldiers with bureaucrats, clergy, and officers and then disabling middle class assimilation should completely stop this glitch from occuring.
* Changed the event that force peaces AI nations with the Neutral flag into a decision instead. If all conditions are met for an event, the earliest it can fire is the beginning of the next month. This created a delay where players could call in Neutral flagged AI nations into wars for a month, then instantly call them in again because ending wars via event doesn't give a truce. Decisions can be fired the same day conditions are met, so players cannot abuse Neutral flagged AI nations this way anymore.
* Death of Ranjit Singh event won't fire unless UK has no truce with Punjab. This prevents a bug that made UK unable to join the Anglo-Sikh war which would result in an immediate white peace.
* Added missing naval invasion penalty to several coastal provinces.
* Added missing ports to Calvinia, Nikolaev, and Narva.
* Reduced Province Size modifier in Mosul sulphur mine to 3x.

* Reduced mountain defense bonus from 3 to 2 and marsh defense bonus from 2 to 1.
* Combined Apulia and Brasilicata states.

## Gameplay changes:
* Added Request Cease Fire decision for use in multiplayer games. This triggers an event for all human countries the player is at war with that gives them the option to return occupied (not owned) territory back to the player's control. This was added to speed up adding wargoals on nations after one side has surrendered.
* Added "Remove Cores" and "Add Cores" province selector decisions. These allow the player to remove all other countries' cores or add their own cores to a state. Has a cooldown of 15 years and takes 15 years for the cores to be added or removed. If a province in the state is occupied or changes ownership before the 15 year timer is up then the addition and removal of cores will be cancelled for that province. Players will vote to enable these decisions or stick with the old RNG based event system of coring provinces at the start of a new game; the two are mutually exclusive.
* Added an option to allow all economic policies to manually build factories. This feature will be voted on at the start of a new game.
* Enable or Disable Crises event changed to be based on majority vote instead of automatically being disabled if a single player voted no.

* Canal decisions are no longer restricted to great powers.

* Made farmers, labourers, and artisans more likely to migrate to mining RGOs.

* Added 1 per port limit to Battleships, Dreadnoughts, and Carriers.
* Increased pop limit for Declare Neutrality decision from 2M, 3M, and 4M for the years of 1860, 1885, and 1910 to 3M, 4M, and 6M.

* Fixed a bug that caused the game to crash when AI France or UK unlocked colonial negotiations and declared war on Sokoto.
* Disabled construction of 0 infamy Liberate Country cb.
* Restored prerequisites for Megali Idea and Form Byzantine Empire decisions.
* Set infrastructure of urban capital provinces to the appropriate level based on tech in the 1913 and WW1 bookmarks.
* Removed leftover Ukrainian and Tatar pops in 1836 multiplayer bookmark.
* Renamed starting Sikh Empire general "Ranjit Singh" to "Maharaja Ranjit Singh". The decision to begin the Anglo-Sikh war requires Ranjit Singh to have died, however Sikh Empire would sometimes roll another general named Ranjit Singh while the first was still alive which would result in the Anglo-Sikh war never being able to fire.
* Fixed Congo Orientale going to Congo Free State if the Congo Conference event is successful.

## Interface changes:
* Added a Small State CB province flag to all provinces within the small state population threshold. Now players can see which states they are allowed to use the Acquire small state cb on by clicking on a province and looking for the Small State CB flag. This CB still cannot be used against capital states or Sub Saharan African uncivilized nations.

* AI nations cannot use national foci on states below 10,000 population and AI nations with a national population over 1,000,000 cannot use national foci on states below 150,000 population. This should help the AI choose better states to use it's national foci on.
* Removed acquire Siberian state cb. The number of provinces in Siberian states was cut in half since the Siberian state cb was introduced, so it is no longer necessary to have a seperate cb with different warscore calculations for them.
* Set max stockpile of goods from 3000 to 2000.
* Added decisions for GPs to annex Lagos via decision before Colonial Negations is invented.
* All provinces with liferating above 40 will be lowered to 35 in 1900.

###### Italy:
* Allowed the War of Unification cb to be used by Italian nations against other Italian nations. This CB requires nationalism and imperialism to unlock and normally it can't be used against nations in the same culture group.
* Removed Form North Italy and Form South Italy decisions. These are redundant now that Italian countries can use the free War of Unification cb against each other. North Italian countries still have the Unite Northern Italy decision that annexes all the North Italian minors.
* Added First Italian War of Independence event chain that triggers after the Hungarian Revolution happens in the normal 1836 bookmark and after Austria uses the Annex Hungary decision in the multiplayer bookmark.

* Added -30% supply consumption and -3% tax efficiency to the Crown Rule modifier, the former of which makes Raj armies cheaper to supply but also lowers their military score by 30%. This should make the Raj less likely to become a GP once it civilizes.

* Enabled "Allow pops/factories to buy from stockpile" button in the trade screen. NEVER enable this feature while you are manually buying goods or it will glitch the world market. In order to utilize the goods received from the new Trade Agreement system, the nation receiving the goods must enable the "Allow pops/factories to buy from stockpile" button and NOT manually buy or sell anything. The nation sending the goods must manually buy the goods it is sending and must have this button turned OFF.

The starting POPs in these provinces that don't work in the mines have been converted to artisans.

## Interface changes:
* New UI design.


# Version 0.2 - 6/16/2020
## General gameplay changes:
* Added two scenarios starting in Jan 1 1914 and July 28 1914. The 1914.1.1 bookmark is an open ended campaign and does not feature a WW1 event because it is impossible to add multiple countries to the same war via events, and the 1914.7.1 bookmark starts with WW1 already underway.
* Removed admin points from province selector decisions.  All previous province selector decisions have alternate costs or maluses associated with them now. Some decisions were removed entirely.
* Added province selector decision that allows you to pass one reform without the approval of the upper house every 10 years. Other prerequisites must still be met, e.g. trinket healthcare cannot be passed unless a country has medicine researched and it cannot be less than 6 months since another reform was passed.
* Added ability to toggle non-accepted culture POP promotion on and off.  If a province only has 1 culture type of craftsmen, all POPs that promote into craftsmen in that province will assimilate into that culture. This is called the craftsmen exploit and it is hardcoded into the game. Turning off non-accepted craftsmen promotion prevents the craftsmen exploit from turning your primary/accepted POPs into non accepted POPs if it is done before any non-accepted POPs have become craftsmen in a particular province. The best way to use this decision is to turn off non-accepted culture craftsmen promotion at the start of the game then turn it back on once you've filled enough provinces with accepted culture craftsmen POPs.
* Increased chance of a POP joining a movement based on CON.
* Removed CON reducing effect of clergy.
* Increased militancy gain from POPs wanting reforms back to vanilla levels.

* Increased normal rate of internal migration and removed the immigrant push from the province migration decision. The province migration attraction modifier itself was also reduced so that it will not capture all internal migration.
* Added tiny conquest CB that lets you annex a country with less than 150k POP for 5 infamy.
* Changed tech requirement for establish financial center decision to modern central bank system instead of fiat monetary system. The province you place the financial center in must also now have at least 90% literacy rate.
* Added +25% iron/coal production to mechanized mining tech and deleted advanced ore smelting process and pit coal inventions.
* Added +25% supply limit to basic chemistry and removed 25% supply limit from electricity.
* Decreased organisation and morale bonuses from tech. Armies should run out of organisation before manpower until 1890 tech.
* Nerfed experience gain from pyschology techs to vanilla levels.
* Changed colonial transportation penal policy to punitive labour. Punitive labour does not give increased colonial migration anymore.
* Increased administrative multiplier for settlement and indirect rule colonial policies. This number raises the required bureaucrat % in order to get 100% admin efficiency.
* Removed the military hospital bonus and infamy growth from geneva convention. The modifier now gives -0.02 war exhaustion and +10% supply consumption.
* Replaced admin points techs with national idea techs. Each tech triggers an event that lets you choose an idea group from a list, which then triggers another event that let's you choose between 1 out of the 2 ideas in that group. Each idea grants a unique bonus and you can only have a total of 6 ideas.

* Removed the ability for human players to trigger the taiping rebellion early. Now it always triggers in 1851. China still cannot declare wars for acquire state or conquest before the taiping rebellion occurs.
* Removed mandate of heaven modifier.
* Added imperial examinations modifier. Imperial examinations give +100% admin efficiency and -30% research points. It can be removed via decision.
* Added early and late qing reform decisions. They both give a modifier that gives +2 daily base research points, however the early one also gives +0.2 global militancy and the later one can only be enacted in 1895.
* Changed the way boxer rebels work. When they capture a province, they kill 50% of the clergy and 3% of the all POPs in the province. When they enforce their demands by occupying the capital they remove 2 economic reforms, 2 military reforms, and both early and late qing reforms. Boxer rebels only spawn after China reaches 50% civilization progress.
* Disabled ability for China to gain research points from conquest. Not even passing military reforms can enable this. You'll have to enact the early qing reforms decision if you want to civilize quickly.

Only gold labourers can work in precious metal mines and all income earned from the gold mines goes directly to the labourers instead of the aristocrats that owns the province. Goods demand of gold labourers was also increased to be several times higher than normal labourers. This ensures that 100% of the money earned by gold mining POPs gets distributed to the world market instead of getting lost in national banks.
* Changed the way general traits work. They now only give + attack or defense, and the amount they give is color coded and listed in the name of the trait so you can see how much bonus you get without having to hover over the general. Black text is +1, blue is +2, green is +3, red is +4, and white is +5.

The amount of POPs gained from the baby boom event follows a bell curve based on state size which means you get the most POPs from using it on states with around 500K population.
* Imported Sub-Saharan African nations and their respective populations from HPM.
* Added a clause to all conquering cbs that prevent them from being used on uncivilized Sub-Saharan African nations before colonial negotiations are invented.

The second cb can only be used by civilized countries with the colonial negotiations invention against uncivilized Sub-Saharan African countries and it costs no infamy.
* Disabled loans due to the bugged nature of interest payments not being paid out to lenders. AI nations also don't seem to pay back debt even when they have enough money to repay it which results in more unnecessary money being taken out of the economy. May re-introduce loans to human players in a later update.
* Added a request grant decision that lets players receive grants from other human players. Only works in multiplayer games.
* Rolled back some of the bonus to assimilation in the new world compared to the old world. Also added a bonus to assimilation to Africa after it was discovered that African provinces suffer the same hidden hardcoded penalty to assimilation as new world provinces.

* Added ghost unit cleanup event that fires every 6 months. Any country that is mobilized or has ships remaining after being annexed will inherit a province from Jan Mayen for a month to allow them to disband their ships and demobilize.
* Added event that fires once every 10 years to fix 100% RGO unemployment in some provinces. Normally, if supply for a RGO good is higher than demand, POPs in a province with the oversupplied good will never be hired until world market demand exceeds supply. If a province gets occupied or is recently colonized, all POPs are set to 100% unemployment and if the good in that province is a commonly overproduced good like grain or fruit, those POPs may never become employed for the rest of the game. This event reduces world wide throughput in all RGOs for a few days in order to get those POPs working again. Once the effect wears off some unemployment should come back, but it won't be 100% unless that province gets occupied again.
* Added strategic goods RGO modifier to a few low population oil/rubber provinces that historically produced much more resources than the game represents.
* Split new world migration into 2 pools: North America/Oceania and South America. Roughly half the worlds pops will migrate to NA/Oceania for the first 6 months of the game and the other half will migrate to South America. Then in July the POPs that would have migrated to NA/Oceania will now migrate to South America. This cycle repeats every year and ensures that at least 6 different countries in the new world can receive immigrants at any one time.

Tt is no longer possible to cut off the Balkans and Anatolia with ships, you must occupy Istanbul to separate them.

## Country balance changes:
###### China:

* Province Selector buildings and their associated decisions have been added as a way to give players unprecedented control over their POPs and provinces. When playing an uncivilized nation, you must restart your game after you civilize in order to build province selectors due to a bug in the way the game stores invention files.
* A new resource called Admin Points has been introduced as a cost to enact these new Province Selector decisions. You gain a base stipend of 100 AP per year plus extra for each level of economic thought researched. Each province selector decision costs anywhere from 250 to 1000 AP.
* The new decisions are  organized into three categories: country, state, and province level. The player can dynamically choose exactly what the target of each decision will be. Some examples of new decisions are increasing literacy, increasing draft laws, accelerated assimilation, encouraging soldiers, lowering militancy, changing ideology, switching RGOs, boosting RGO throughput, and more.
* Province Selector decisions and Admin Points can be permanently disabled for all players by enacting the "Disable Province Selector" decision at the start of the game. The decision is available only in the first month. If you are playing in a multiplayer game and you have a player on the UK, then only the UK player can enact the decision.

## General gameplay changes:
* HPM reforms have been ported over. Most have a similar effect.
* Almost all random events have been deleted. Most of their effects were included in the new Province Selector decisions.
* Non accepted culture POPs and overseas POPs cannot join a non nationalist rebel movement. Overseas is defined in game as not connected to the capital and on a different continent, so you can still get occasional ideological rebels in provinces that have no way to reach your capital, but this should be extremely rare now.
* Triggered country size modifiers come into effect at 1M, 3.5M, 7.5M, 17.5M, 30M, 60M, and 120M POPs. These mostly affect things like tax efficiency, tariffs, and admin efficiency. Smaller nations get a bonus to these while larger nations get a nerf.
* Assimilation has been reworked so that all POPs have a chance to assimilate that is based on lifeneeds, militancy, and literacy. It is now possible to assimilate a small amount of POPs in provinces with their culture core. POPs in provinces without a culture core will have 4x faster assimilation rate than POPs living in provinces with their culture core, and POPs in New World provinces have an additional 4x bonus on top of that. Your government's citizenship policy also has large modifiers on assimilation rate now. Assimilation rate and assimilation chance are two separate factors, if either one is 0 then no assimilation will take place. Note that if you look in the game files at the actual assimilation chances in the poptypes files, they will at first make no sense. This is because it discovered during the making of this mod that there are several hidden and hardcoded modifiers to assimilation depending on where the target POP is located, and new modifiers were created taking into account the effects of these hidden modifiers. POPs located in a culture core province outside the New World were found to have a hidden modifier that resulted in having 1/100th the listed assimilation chance as a POP located in a province without a culture core, and POPs in the New World have 1/10th and 1/1000th the listed assimilation chance for non culture core and culture core locations.
* Emigration rate has been changed to a more flat rate than in the base game. All Old World civilized countries start out bleeding a small amount of immigrants and that rate slowly increases as the game progresses without getting as extreme as vanilla levels. Chinese POPs will not emigrate so fully occupying China will not result in millions of Chinese immigrants. Non Chinese POPs in China will still emigrate.
* Immigration attraction changed so that war exhaustion gives a penalty. Being at war with a country also prevents immigrants from the country you're at war with from coming to your country.
* Being a sphereleader or sphereling gives a bonus to immigrant attraction between the two countries.
* There are seperate promotion factors for POPs in states below 2M population, between 2M-4M population, and 4M+ population. POPs in states under 2M have normal promotion, POPs in states between 2M-4M have roughly 1/2 the normal promotion rate, and POPs in states above 4M have roughly 1/4 the normal promotion rate. This means a POP in a state of 8M will only promote twice as many POPs as a POP in a state of 1M.
* Promotion national focus has been split into normal state, large state, and massive state national focuses. Normal promotion national focus can only be used on states below 2M POPs, large state national focus on states between 2M-4M POPs, and massive can only be used on states over 4M POPs. Large and extra large state promotion focuses give 2/3 and 1/3 the promotion bonus as normal state promotion focus.
* Disease events have been reworked to be more logical. In vanilla, most disease events have a % chance to fire for every country, and when a disease event fired it would then target one single province or state in that country. The % chance to fire similar for every country no matter the size. This meant that the chance of cholera breaking out in one particular province was lowered simply by conquering more provinces. This didn't make sense as the conditions to develop cholera should depend on the level of sanitation and public health in that specific province. All disease events now either affect the entire country, or have a % chance to fire in a particular province that is independent of the country's size. The influenza event now gives a country modifier called "immunity" that prevents you from catching the same influenza for the next 10 years. This will stop the influenza ping pong that sometimes happens when you border many smaller nations.
* Clergy and bureacrat costs have been increased. Base literacy gain decreased to make clergy more important. It is not uncommon to not be able to fully fund education, admin, and soldiers at the start of the game.
* Healthcare reform will be your main source of POP growth and it is funded by the social spending slider. Each level of healthcare reform must be funded a certain minimum % to receive any benefits at all, and the reforms are massively expensive. The money spent on healthcare reform goes directly into the pockets of POPs and this has the secondary effect of stabilizing the world economy. When POPs have more money they can afford to buy more goods, which means your POPs can also sell more of their goods, which means they make more money from their regular jobs. Even though it isn't historical, healthcare was designed to give POPs money in order to force players to give money back to their POPs if they want POP growth, otherwise there would be no incentive to fund the social spending slider.
* Pharmaceuticals and cigarettes introduced as new consumer goods. Pharmaceuticals require opium as an input good and is unlocked after researching medicine while cigarettes require tobacco and is available from the start.
* Fabric can now be made from either cotton or wool. Cotton fabric factories are the same as vanilla, and the new wool fabric factories require 1/4 as much input as cotton factories while producing 1/4 as much output. Wool factories are usually more profitable early game if you lack dye due to them using 1/4 as much dye as cotton factories.
* A few raw goods RGOs such as coal and iron have been increased for multiplayer balance. RGO spread events from tractors, electrical lighting, nitroglycerin, machine tools, and distribution channels now trigger immediately in all non colonial states. They also trigger if you have the invention and conquer a non colonial state that doesn't have the modifier yet.
* A new revanchism mechanic has been introduced. For every 5 revanchism your country has, your mobilisation pool and maximum soldier pop % in cored territory goes up by 0.5% each. The bonus is capped at 5% and is calculated by number of core provinces lost, not by population size lost. The formula for calculating revanchism is hard coded into the game unfortunately.
* Laissez faire no longer has a tax cap. It provides a 3% output bonus to factory production and cheaper factory startup costs.
* Liberate, free people, and crises cbs no longer remove cores from the losing country. Added acquire small state cb that lets you take a state with less than 150k POP for 5 infamy, minor conquest cb that lets you annex a country with less than 400k POP and 2 states for 10 infamy, take capital cb that lets you take a country's capital at any time, and acquire all core cb that lets you take all your cores in one war.
* Soldier caps at 4%, 3%, and 2% for cored states with 1M, 2M, and 4M population. Non cored states over 1M, 2M, and 4M population have 2%, 1.5%, and 1% max soldier caps.
* SOLDIER_TO_POP_DAMAGE ratio increased from 0.2 in vanilla to 0.25 which results in 4 to 1 casualty to death ratio compared to 5 to 1 in vanilla. POP deaths from soldier casualties is calculated as SOLDIER_TO_POP_DAMAGE/(1 + military_hospital modifier). Military hospitals and geneva convention now give up to a combined 20% military hospital modifier, so the final value for POP deaths from soldier casualties if all techs and the geneva convention are unlocked is 0.25/(1+0.2) = 0.208, or roughly 4.8 casualties to equal 1 pop death.
* Lategame artillery support and defense has been nerfed. Now artillery only has roughly 2x more defense than offense after all techs are researched.
* Guards are strictly better than infantry, but cost twice as much. Tanks now have 25% support which means they can attack at 25% effectiveness from the backline and can only be recruited from primary culture POPs.
* Battleships and dreadnoughts received buffs, cruiser torpedo attack was removed completely, commerce raiders normal gun attack almost completely removed and replaced with large bonuses to torpedo attack, and max wooden ship HP reduced. Torpedo attack is a special type of attack that only affects big ships and deals no damage to light ships, making commerce raiders almost useless versus cruisers but deadly in numbers against big ships. The meta is big ships > cruisers > commerce raiders > big ships and if you build too much of one type of ship you risk being countered by another.
* Spherelings receive a large tax efficiency boost to make being in a sphere not as crippling to your economy.
* States have been redrawn in various places to buff countries by either giving them more port provinces or combining states to make promotion go faster.
* Crises no longer give a prestige hit for not joining.
* Great War disarmament cb no longer automatically added to all countries in a great war. It costs 0 infamy and 0 warscore to demand, so you can still add it to all enemy participants. This is a multiplayer change to allow the prestige and reparations to be spread out amongst the alliance.
* Enabled adding cbs on puppet nations.
* Diplomat travel time reduced to 1 day.
* AI nations receive significant buffs. AI nations will have more population, bigger armies, bigger industry, and better tech than compared to vanilla.
* Added straits between West Indies islands and Lesser Antilles islands.
* Added strait from Cadiz to Tangier, from Balearic Islands to Barcelona, and from Canary Islands to Tarfaya.
* Added a strait between Nagasaki and Chebu, and from Chebu to Kwangju.


## Country Balance Changes:
###### China:
* Starts with Chinese Isolationism modifier that reduces research point gain and prevents the use of acquire state and conquer cbs. This modifier will only be removed once the Taiping Rebellion occurs.
* Gave a decision to allow early triggering of the Taiping Rebellion when played by a human.
* Yunnan, Guangxi, and Qinghai all start as part of China.
* Only gets 20% of the bonus from mobilization techs and reforms
###### United Kingdom:
* Starting indian soldier POPs slightly nerfed
* The doctrine of lapse event to annex indian minors can still trigger even if the minor has more than 15 prestige
* Empress of India decision replaced with Establish the Raj decision. This decision triggers the Sepoy Rebellion, which causes all Indian puppets to be annexed into one country and a war to break out between the newly formed India and UK.  This allows the UK to annex all Indian minors at the time of their choosing. If this decision is not taken, the Sepoy Rebellion event will still occur once breech loaded rifles has been researched.
###### Russia:
* Stuck with serfdom, which gives a large malus to education efficiency, until either the year 1870 or they become a hms government/democracy.
###### Prussia:
* Gets an event in 1880 that reduces the liferating in Germany to 35.
* Forming NGF via decision or Germany via the crown from the gutter event locks the country into confederalism. Forming Germany via decision clears the confederalism flag and turns the country into a unitary state.
###### Austria:
* Added decisions to accept Czech, Polish, Slovenian, and Croatian cultures.
* Starts with a bonus to mobilization pool to represent the various ethnicities that could be mobilized in the Austrian Empire but can't  be represented with the base game mechanics due to not being accepted POPs. As you add more ethnicities to your accepted POPs, this bonus to mobilization pool will shrink until it eventually disappears.
###### Ottoman Empire:
* Added decisions to accept Mashriqi, Kurdish, Bedouin, Misri, Albanian, and Bosnian cultures.
* Starts with Christian Subjugation modifier that gives benefits to taxes and mobilization pool, but also gives an education penalty and pop militancy.
* The Oriental Crisis can be triggered via decision, and it gives the Ottomans a CB to puppet Egypt. Once Egypt is a puppet, a new decision appears that lets the Ottomans civilize Egypt and then annex them.
* Many balkan states start with large population boom modifiers that substantially increases their population in the first few years of the game.
###### United States:
* Removed all events relating to the civil war. The ACW has a chance to trigger starting in 1860 as long as slavery hasn't been abolished before then.
###### Spain & Portugal:
* Moved the Carlist rebels at the start of the game to Madrid. All you have to do is not kill the rebels and you will switch over to Carlist Spain when they capture Madrid.
* Added a decision to form Iberian Union as any Iberian culture country.
###### Italy:
* Italian Minors get an extra route to unify Italy. If a north Italian minor owns all of northern Italy plus Rome they can form Italy without needing the southern half, additionally if a north Italian minor owns Milan it gets a decision to automatically inherit most of northern Italy. If Papal States or Two Sicilies owns all cores of each other plus Tuscany and the island of Sardinia, they can form Italy as well.
###### Scandinavia:
* Any Scandinavian culture country can form Scandinavia without having to be a GP if they own Christiana, Stockholm, and Copenhagen
###### Low Countries:
* Gave Luxembourg to Belgium at the start.
* Gave the Netherlands Boer as an accepted culture.
###### Greece, Serbia, Romanian Minors:
* Every balkan minor country starts with a large population boom modifier that will have increased their population by 50-75% in the first few years of the game. Additionaly, while not country specific, the new revanchism mechanic and small nation triggered modifiers give extremely large bonuses to max soldier % and mobilization pools to these countries.
* Wallachia and Moldavia have a decision to form Romania that can be activated at any time when played by a human, and 1859 when played by AI.
* Serbia can form Yugoslavia if it owns all of its Serbian cores instead of having to own all of Yugoslavia.
* If Greece reclaims its cores in both Greece and Anatolia, it gets an event to increase its Greek population by 100% while reducing its Turkish population by 80%.
###### Mexico:
* Establishing the 2nd Mexican Empire turns the country into a hms government, gives a few reforms, and gives all POPs 10 militancy and 10 consciousness. The decision is available once the ACW begins and cannot be taken once the ACW is over.
###### South America:
* All South American starting POPs replaced with HPM starting POPs. In most cases this equates to anywhere from a 10% to a 100% increase in starting population.
* Argentina given a decision to become a democracy and pass several reforms all at once.
###### Uncivilized Nations:
* Reform costs were reduced
* Muhammad Ali's reforms, Dar al Funun, and Meiji Restoration decisions all buffed.
